# English Literature Board Game
## Description

Literate Legends is a board game designed for visually impaired players, accommodating 2 to 4 participants. Each player has a pawn and advances across the game board by answering questions. Pressing a button generates a question related to two classic English literary works – Hamlet and The Lord of the Rings. If the player answers correctly, their pawn moves forward by one space. The winner is the first to reach the final space. All game elements and actions are narrated by a digital reader, ensuring full accessibility for visually impaired players.
